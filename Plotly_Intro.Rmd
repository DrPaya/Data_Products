Web application for creating and ssharing data visualizations. Can work with many different languages. 

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter")


##Adding colors
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~factor(cyl))

##Different example
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~disp)

##Changing the sizing of scatter as a factor of one of the variables
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", 
        color = ~factor(cyl), size = ~hp)

##Example of 3D scatter plot
set.seed(2016-07-21)
temp <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 5)
pressue <- rnorm(100)
dtime <- 1:100
plot_ly(x = ~temp, y = ~pressue, z = ~dtime,
        type = "scatter3d", color = ~temp)

##Example of line graph, whic his the default
data("airmiles")
plot_ly(x = ~time(airmiles), y = ~airmiles, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")

##Multi Line graph
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("EuStockMarkets")

stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
  gather(index, price) %>%
  mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))
plot_ly(stocks, x = ~time, y = ~price, color = ~index, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```
